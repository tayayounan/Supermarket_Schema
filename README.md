# Supermarket Schema Project

In this project, I created a SQL-based schema for a supermarket, including populated fields and several queries to analyze different aspects of the supermarket's operations. Key queries include:

- Checking product availability across stores
- Calculating total sales by store
- Identifying the top customers based on loyalty points
- Analyzing average product ratings by category
- Summarizing supplier details and their associated product counts
  
This small task serves as a practical demonstration of SQL query capabilities for database management and data analysis in a retail context.
